RC Vehicle Location Estimation based on Tags and Cameras
===========

Diploma Project

This paper proposes an accessible method by which anyone can implement an automated 
system for performing various tasks. Using a phone, a stable communication system, and a 
controllable device, users can command the latter device to perform tasks assigned via the 
phone. This approach democratizes access to automation technologies, facilitating their 
widespread adoption.
